# HTML & CSS Templates

In this repository I will list my progression on HTML and CSS.
I will do so by creating responsive websites and elements of websites using pure HTML and CSS.

This will consist of 
- Navbars
- Dropdown menus
- Side bars
- Forms
- Animations
- Headers
- Footers
- Front pages
- HTML Media items
- HTML APIs
  * Geolocation
  * Drag and drop
  * Web storage
  * Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- and more..

In the end the goal will be to make a website showcasing all this work.
